A bunch of C++ and Node.js stuff shared among my projects:

  * common: a grab-bag of C++ utilities like stringprintf, wrappers around pthreads, read/write STL into JSON, etc.
  * lapack : numerical stuff, including C++ and node.js wrappings of LAPACK functions
  * genes: a simple genome library, not good for anything yet
  * nodeif: wrap C++ code for Node.js
  * realtime: obsolete
  * web: a Node.JS + browser web application framework
